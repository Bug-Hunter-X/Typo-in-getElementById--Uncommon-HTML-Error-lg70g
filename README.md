# Uncommon HTML Error: Typo in getElementById

This repository demonstrates a subtle error that can occur when working with JavaScript and HTML.  The error is a simple typo in `getElementById`, a frequently used function. Although not a typical HTML error, it's an example of how easy it is to introduce bugs when integrating JavaScript into your HTML.

## Bug Description

The `bug.html` file contains a typo in the `getElementById` function call within the embedded JavaScript.  This results in a runtime error, typically a `TypeError` because the incorrect function doesn't exist.

## Solution

The `solution.html` file shows the corrected code with the typo fixed. It illustrates the correct way to access the element by its ID.
